# Progress

## What Works

### Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **DDEV Environment**: Containerized development environment fully configured
- **Drupal 11 Base**: Core Drupal 11 installation with recommended-project structure
- **Dependency Management**: Composer setup with all required dependencies
- **Quality Assurance**: Complete QA toolchain (PHPUnit, PHPStan, PHPCS) integrated

### Development Workflow ‚úÖ
- **Automated Installation**: `composer clean-install` script provides one-command setup
- **Module Development**: Proper directory structure for contrib/custom modules
- **Configuration Management**: Config export/import system ready
- **Version Control**: Git repository with appropriate .gitignore and .gitattributes

### Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **Automated Testing**: PHPUnit configured with custom scripts
- **Static Analysis**: PHPStan with strict rules and deprecation checking
- **Code Standards**: PHPCS with Drupal coding standards
- **Test Environment**: Simpletest directory structure in place

### Essential Modules ‚úÖ
- **Admin Toolbar**: Enhanced administrative interface
- **Drush**: CLI management tools
- **Development Tools**: Devel and Developer Console modules available

## What's Left to Build

### Documentation & Guidelines üìù
- **Module Development Guide**: Best practices for creating new modules
- **Testing Guidelines**: How to write and run effective tests
- **Contribution Workflow**: Steps for contributing modules back to Drupal.org
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

### Enhanced Development Experience üîß
- **IDE Integration**: Documentation for PHPStorm/VSCode setup
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks for automated QA checking
- **Performance Monitoring**: Local performance testing tools
- **Security Scanning**: Security analysis integration

### Advanced Features üöÄ
- **Multi-site Setup**: Support for testing modules across multiple Drupal instances
- **Automated Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline for module testing
- **Cross-Version Testing**: Testing modules against multiple Drupal versions
- **API Documentation**: Automated API documentation generation

## Current Status

### Project State: **Production Ready** üü¢
The Drupal sandbox is fully functional and ready for module development. All core infrastructure is in place and working.

### Memory Bank Status: **Complete** ‚úÖ
- All core memory bank files created and populated
- Documentation hierarchy established
- Context fully captured for future Cline sessions

### Next Priorities:
1. **Immediate**: Begin module development in `web/modules/under_development/`
2. **Short-term**: Utilize Drupal core and contrib APIs for module functionality
3. **Medium-term**: Implement comprehensive testing for developed modules
4. **Long-term**: Expand module capabilities and create additional modules

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Production Deployment**: Environment not configured for production use (by design)
- **Windows Compatibility**: DDEV may require additional setup on Windows systems
- **Resource Usage**: Docker containers require adequate system resources

### Potential Improvements
- **Performance**: Could optimize container startup time
- **Storage**: Large vendor directory could benefit from volume mounting optimization
- **Networking**: Local SSL certificates could be pre-configured

### Dependencies to Monitor
- **DDEV Updates**: Regular updates needed to maintain compatibility
- **Drupal Security**: Core and contrib modules need regular security updates
- **PHP Version**: Future PHP version compatibility considerations

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Choices
- **DDEV over Lando/Docker Compose**: Chosen for simplicity and Drupal-specific optimizations
- **Minimal Profile**: Selected to reduce complexity and focus on module functionality
- **Composer-First**: Embraced modern PHP dependency management practices

### Quality Assurance Evolution
- **Comprehensive QA**: Integrated multiple tools from the start rather than adding incrementally
- **Automation Focus**: Emphasized scripted workflows over manual processes
- **Drupal Standards**: Strict adherence to community coding standards

### Development Workflow Refinements
- **Clean Install Strategy**: Prioritized reproducible environments over persistent setups
- **Module-Centric Design**: Optimized for module development rather than site building
- **Configuration as Code**: Emphasized version-controlled configuration management

### Recent Decisions
- **Memory Bank Implementation**: Added comprehensive documentation system for continuity
- **Documentation First**: Prioritized clear documentation for future development
- **Structured Approach**: Implemented hierarchical documentation system
- **Development Focus**: Prioritized module development in `web/modules/under_development/`
- **API Integration**: Emphasized use of Drupal core and contrib module APIs

## Success Metrics

### Achieved Goals ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Environment setup time: < 5 minutes (achieved via DDEV + composer scripts)
- ‚úÖ Zero manual configuration for basic development
- ‚úÖ All QA tools functional without additional setup
- ‚úÖ Clean test execution for standard modules

### Ongoing Measurements
- **Developer Onboarding**: Time for new developers to become productive
- **Code Quality**: Pass rate for QA tools across different modules
- **Environment Consistency**: Success rate of clean installations
- **Documentation Effectiveness**: Feedback from memory bank usage

The project has achieved its core objectives and provides a solid foundation for Drupal module development. The memory bank system ensures continuity and knowledge retention across development sessions.
