# Project Brief

## Project Overview
This is a Drupal 11 development sandbox designed for local development, testing, and quality assurance of Drupal modules. It serves as a standardized environment for module development and contribution to the Drupal ecosystem.

## Core Requirements
- **Primary Goal**: Provide a robust, standardized Drupal 11 development environment
- **Target Use**: Local development, testing, and QA of Drupal modules
- **Environment**: DDEV-based containerized development stack
- **Drupal Version**: Drupal 11 (latest stable)

## Key Features Required
1. **Development Environment**
   - DDEV containerized setup for consistent development
   - Complete Drupal 11 installation with minimal profile
   - Admin toolbar for enhanced administrative experience

2. **Quality Assurance Tools**
   - PHPUnit for automated testing
   - PHPStan for static analysis  
   - PHPCS for coding standards compliance
   - Automated test execution workflows

3. **Module Development Support**
   - Proper directory structure for contrib/custom modules
   - Development dependencies (devel, developer_console)
   - Configuration management ready

## Success Criteria
- Developers can quickly spin up a Drupal 11 environment
- All QA tools work seamlessly for module testing
- Clean installation process that can be repeated reliably
- Proper separation of contrib, custom, and core code

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- Local development environment setup
- Testing infrastructure for modules
- Code quality tools integration
- Basic Drupal 11 functionality

**Out of Scope:**
- Production deployment configurations
- Content creation or site building
- Performance optimization for large sites
- Custom theme development (focus is on modules)

## Timeline & Priority
- **High Priority**: Working development environment with QA tools
- **Medium Priority**: Enhanced developer experience features
- **Low Priority**: Advanced configuration or optimization

This project brief serves as the foundation for all development decisions and guides the technical implementation approach.
